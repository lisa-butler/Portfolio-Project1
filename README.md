## User Experience 

<a name="ux"></a>
###Pre project planning: 
Before starting this project, I considered several options, ultimately landing on the concept of a shore dive database site as this is something Ireland does not have. I also have a passion for diving and a range of dive sites and images from them that I could use for my project.
I explored other diving websites in Ireland, such as diving.ie for ideas for color theme and structure.
For the purpose of this project, I chose to include just seven of potentially hundreds of sites in order to demonstrate the nature of the site within the time frame of the project creation.

Strategy:
Determining the best approach meant investigating the needs of the potential users. This included the needs of the divers looking for a dive site and those of potential contributors to the website.

User stories:
As a diver:
I was to be able to find dive sites in Ireland.
I want to be able to narrow my search by county.
I want to know the depth range at this site.
I want to know specific interests in this site.
I want to know how to access this site.
I want to know what level of diver skill this dive requires.
I want to know how to dive this site.
I want to know when the best time to dive this site is.

As a contributor:
I want to be able to access an index of dives and see if my site has already been added.
I want to be able to contact the page administrators to submit a new site.
I want to access information about dives.
I want to know when my site is added or when new sites are added by my peers.

Scope:
The website should have a clear and consistent layout including navigation and social media links.
The website should be accessible on all devices for divers to access on the go.
The home page of the website should include a welcome message explaining to users the purpose of the website and directing them towards the content.
The website should provide an easily navigable list of dive sites with a method of narrowing down sites by location.
Each dive site write up should contain enough information for a diver to find the site and successfully dive it. 
Images and videos should be included to showcase shore diving in Ireland.
The dive site information should be easy to interpret.
There should be a method for contributors to contact the website administrators.

Structural planning:
In order for the website to achieve these goals it was decided to have four pages; Home, Dive Sites, Media and Contact.

Home:
This page should contain an overview of what the purpose of the site is.
The navigation bar should be clear and easy to access.
An image banner should display diving related imagery.
A prompt to take the diver to the dive sites and a prompt to get in contact should be present.
Social media links should also feature.

Dive Sites:
This page should contain the same theme as the other pages.
There should be a dropdown menu to jump to sites by location.
Sites should be arranged by location and kept within groupings.
Each site should be clearly separate from the next and should contain all required information.
Media should be used to improve the user experience.
A return to top button should be available at the bottom of the page to stop the user from having to scroll back to the top.

Media:
This page should contain the same theme as the other pages.
This page should display images from irish shore dives as well as video content.
Content should be accessible on the site and via youtube. 
Video content should not autoplay.

Contact:
This page should contain the same media theme as the other pages.
This page should provide a form that a user can fill in to leave a comment or to contribute to the website.
The form should have a section to write a longer comment.
The form should have elements such as name and email as required.
The form should provide the user with an option to register to receive notifications when new sites are added.
The form send button should have a message that confirms the form has been submitted when clicked.

Wireframes:
A homepage wireframe was used to form a basic idea of the proposed layout of the site homepage.
The basic plan for the site was to keep it as uncluttered and minimalistic as possible while providing the required information in a concise manner. As the mean age of divers is generally older, it was intended that the site being as intuitive as possible.

Style:
Background: It was decided after some deliberation not to have a background image running behind the content as this was both distracting and made the content look more cluttered. The decision to leave the background color as white happed towards the end of the design phase when the content had been style and it was decided that this was the most minimalistic and legible approach.

Color: The white background was chosen as it enabled the content to be very legible and to stand out for the user, making the site more navigatable.

The colors eventually selected for use were;
White #FFF -used for the background.
Grey #D3D3D3 -used for hover over functions and detailing.
Teal #008080 -used for heading, sub-headings and buttons.
Black #000 -used for text as black on white is widely known as the most legible combination of colors.
The white background helped the banner images and images in the gallery page to pop out as well as heightening the pop of color in the icon used.

Fonts: 
Fonts were selected based on what was clear and easy to read as well as feeling like they were suited for a diving-based theme. 
The fonts chosen were;
	-Ubuntu
	-Sans-Serif
The focus of these fonts being to provide the information in a non-distracting manner that was viable for the visually impaired user or someone trying to use the site on a mobile device.
